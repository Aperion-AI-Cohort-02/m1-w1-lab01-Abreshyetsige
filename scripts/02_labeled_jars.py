# #  What this shows : variables (labeled jars), reusing them in
# #                    maths, capital letters, and the 4 data types.
# #  Lab STEPs       : STEP 3, 4, 5 and 6
# #  How to run it   : python scripts/02_labeled_jars.py
# #                    (run it from inside the M1-W1-Lab01 folder)

# # # Put the number 12 into a jar labeled beans_in_stock.
beans_in_stock = 12

# # # The afternoon delivery arrives. We refill the SAME jar --
# # # a jar holds one thing, so this REPLACES the 12. It is not 62.

# # this time stored in jars instead of typed as raw numbers.

# # joined by underscores.
